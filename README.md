## MyBatis Integration and Service Switch - Fourth Task

This section outlines tasks for integrating MyBatis DAOs into an existing hierarchy and transitioning service classes to MyBatis. Follow these steps for seamless MyBatis integration.

- Add MyBatis DAOs to the existing hierarchy with the same requirements. Choose any XML or interface mapping.
- Switch service classes to MyBatis.

## XML Handling and JAXB Integration - Fifth Task
This section outlines tasks for creating an XML file, XSD schema, and parsing XML using JAXB. Follow these steps for straightforward XML handling and JAXB integration.

- Create one XML file and XSD schema for at least 5 classes from the below hierarchy.
- Validate XML file using XSD schema and assigned parser.
- Parse XML file using one of the parsers from the title.
- Add JAXB annotations to the hierarchy. Date, List, and complex objects should be covered.
